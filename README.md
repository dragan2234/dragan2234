### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who turned into the blockchain and applied cryptography industry in 2022. having previously specialized as a Drupal developer (from 2016.).

Currently, I'm part of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship where I'm learning more about verkle tries data structure and implementing it for Hyperledge Besu ethereum execution client. The other "research" project that I'm doing is thinking and designing verkle tries in-zk-circuit. The dirty write-up is here: https://hackmd.io/l2XvogKoQOCH748T1rdWZw
