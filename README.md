### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with 6 years of experience doing blockchains and applied cryptography full-time since November 2022.

Currently I'm doing an Ethereum Protocol Fellowship where I'm learning more about verkle tries data structure and implementing it for Hyperledge Besu ethereum execution client. The other "research" project that I'm doing is thinking and designing verkle tries in-zk-circuit. Dirty write-up is here: https://hackmd.io/l2XvogKoQOCH748T1rdWZw

Some of the interesting repos/projects I've been contributing to:

- verkle tries for besu
- cairo-lang
- kakarot zkevm
- reth
- lambdaworks cryptography library
- zama.ai
- evm.codes

Feel free to reach out via Twitter or Linkedin if you are interested in chatting about cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and blockchains.
